    <h2>Will</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!  My name is William Cameron.  You can call me Will or William, I go by either one.  I am married to my beautiful wife, Abby.  We don't have any kids but we have a cat and her name is Luna <p>  
    <p>Currently I am debt collector and I am going to school so I can get a better job.  I am hoping to get into something that deals with technology becasue I love to see how tech can evolve and make improvements in people's lives.  I am currently taking the Applied Technology path in Pathway Worldwide.</p> 
    <p>Something I like to do when I have the time is game and stream.  I am not planning on getting famous but I stream mainly so I can save those great moments for myself and it is something new for me to unwind from work.  I have been playing at my own pace Five Nights at Freddy's Security Breach.  I also found out today that Resident Evil 4 VR just came out with more content so I wlll look into that.</p>
    <p>This is to test my github working.  Wish me luck I hope this works. Did it work?</p>
