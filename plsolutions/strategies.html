            <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
            <p>For the last bit of disclaimer before we begin, understand that there does exist many different versions of lease-to-own agreements with their own unique terms and conditions. The rules that are being presented are based on the leasing terms from one of the leading companies in the lease-to-own market.</p>
            <p>These rules and strategies can be adapted to most financial agreements but, this is not a one size fits all. User discretion is advised.</p>

            <h2>Rollover Method</h2>
            <p>“The Rollover Method” is where you take the money that you have to pay your bills and use it to the cheapest bill off first and then pay the same amount until the next cheapest bill.</p>

            <h2>Example: Rollover Method </h2>
            <p>Suppose that you have 2 bills that are $100 monthly and $200 monthly respectively. This means you pay a total of $300 monthly. Imagine if you paid off the bill that is $200 monthly and combined that money with your $100 monthly bill. If the $100 monthly bill had a total left of $1200 and you continued to pay a total of $300 monthly but focused on the $1200 bill then you would pay off that bill in 4 months instead of 12 months! That means over those same 12 months, in the scenario where the $1200 is paid in 4 months, that means you would be saving 8 months' worth of payments. In addition to that if you completed an early purchase option within those 4 months then you will experience even more savings!</p>



            <h2>Per Check Method</h2>
            <p>This is a simple way to see how much “per check” you need to pay and is based when you get paid.</p>

            <h2>Example: Per Check Method</h2>
            <p>Suppose the following, your income pays you biweekly (every other Friday), your minimum payment is monthly at $300 for 1 year ($3900 in total over 12 payments) and, you have an early purchase option is for 90 days (3 months) for $1700 if you can do it. Typically speaking your income will pay you 2 times every month (some months will pay 3 times) which means you will pay $150 for each check you get to pay for the $300 monthly required (assumingyou pay it by the day it is due). If you were to pay the early purchase optionthen you will need to pay roughly $284 each check (biweekly) to complete thatearly purchase option </p>

            <h2>Early Purchase Option</h2>
            <p>An early purchase option, assuming it is available, is another way to pay off a delinquent or past due account or prevent it altogether. The savings that you get from the early purchase option you can put towards another bill like “The Rollover Strategy.” If you don’t have another bill then you can save that money or spend it on yourself as a reward.</p>

            <h2>Lease Amendment (Note: This is not a restart)</h2>
            <p>Depending on the least-to-own agreement it may offer a tool to change the due dates and frequency of your payments. This can be useful to fix any timing issues that might occur and can keep your lease in a current status. Depending on the leasing company, it might be possible to push out the first payment on a newly amended lease-to-own agreement by 45 days. It would be like having a month and a half break from payments which might help with an early purchase option or time that can be used to take care of other bills.</p>
            

            <h2>Example: Lease Amendment</h2>
            <p>Suppose your payments are due weekly but you get paid biweekly and you want it to match your paydays. If you use a lease amendment then you can set them the way you need it.</p>

            
            <h2>Payment+</h2>
            <p>The “Payment+ Strategy” simply means you pay more than your minimum required payment. This can help save money in the long-term, set you up for an easier early purchase option in the future (if available), and can help with possible payment adjustments in the future.</p>

            <h2>Example: Payment+</h2>
            <p>Suppose the following, minimum payments are $50 biweekly, past due amount $200 and you are 60 days past due. In this example if you pay only the minimum payment then you are preventing the past due amount to increase (which is good) and generally maintaining your days delinquent about the 60-day area (which is okay) however, you are not getting back to current/good standing. In order to keep in accordance to rule 2, you will need to pay at least $100 biweekly to reduce past due amount and days delinquent.</p>
