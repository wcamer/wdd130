            <h1>What Are You Paying For?</h1>
            <p>It is very common in this day for people not to read all the fine print in contracts but, here is a simple way to understand what you are signing up for. Whenever someone takes any type of payment plan to pay for something over time, you are paying for TIME as well as the item.</p>
            <p>Think of a car loan or house loan. Typically people don’t pay their house in cash all in one transaction but they do it over TIME with a loan. The same can be said for a lease-to-own agreement. The benefit is that you get to take home the item(s) without having to pay for it all upfront but, you will pay for the time it takes to pay it off.</p>

            <h1>How Much Are You Paying?</h1>
            <p>How much will a person pay on a lease-to-own agreement?  Here is a simple way to see. Take your recurring payment (payment), multiply it by how many times you will pay for the term (installments) and you get the total amount you will pay for the item over the life of the lease (total).  (Payment * Installments = Total).</p>
            <p>For example, let's take a cellphone that costs $1000 and your payments are weekly at $75 and your term for the lease is 1 year (52weekly payments). If you don’t use any early purchase options and go the full length of the term, you will pay $3900 for a $1000 cellphone. Note that if this same person were to save $75 weekly it would rough 14 weeks to save up the money to buy the same $1000 cellphone upfront instead of paying more over time.</p>

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>There are advantages and disadvantages it all comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer to save money and pay for it all upfront, some like installment plans to pay over time to avoid any large payouts of money. With lease-to-own agreements, they can be very helpful but costly depending on your approach. Understand that the longer you take to pay, the more money you will have to payout.</p>
