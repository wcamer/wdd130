      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Suppose that you are a lease owner and you have fallen on some hard times.  Hard times usually results in late or missing payments.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a tool to help you get through those hard times?  
        For the past five years I have been helping people navigate through those hard times while being a lease owner.  Talking about hard times can be very personal and difficult to do with others.  For this reason my website will help provide the tools needed to simply and discreetly get lease owners back on the right track.

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience is anyone that has a lease-to-own agreement, also known as “lessee”.  Lessees can typically be as young as 18 years old and as old as upper 90’s.  Though the advice and solutions are not age specific typically the information is targeted specifically with those with active leases.  For those that are thinking of aquiring a lease to own agreement the information provided can help educate on possible ways to avoid delinquency altogether or minimize delinquency time on a lease.</p>

      <h3>Home page</h3> Understanding Lease-To-Own Basics
      <p>
        <p>It is very common in this day for people not to read all the fine print in contracts but, here is a simple way to understand what you are signing up for.  Whenever someone takes any type of payment plan to pay for something over time, you are paying for TIME as well as the item.  Think of a car loan or house loan.  Typically people don’t pay their house in cash all in one transaction but they do it over TIME with a loan.  The same can be said for a lease-to-own agreement.  The benefit is that you get to take home the item(s) without having to pay for it all up front but, you will pay for the time it takes to pay it off.</p>
        <p>Question, how much will a person pay on a lease-to-own agreement?  Here is a simple way to see.  Take your recuring payment (payment), multiply it by how many times you will pay for the term (installments) and you get the total amount you will pay for the item over the life of the lease (total). (Payment * Installments = Total).  For example, lets take a cellphone that costs $1000 and your payments are weekly at $75 and your term for the lease is 1 year (52 weekly payments).  If you don’t use any early purchase options and go the full length of the term you will pay $3900 for a $1000 cellphone.  Note that if this same person were to save $75 weekly it would rough 14 weeks to save up the money to by the same $1000 cellphone upfront instead of paying more over time.  If someone will pay more than the value of the item then why use a lease-to-own agreement at all?  There are advantages and disadvantages it all comes down to personal preference.  Some people prefer to save money and pay for it all upfront, some like installment plans to pay over time to avoid any large payouts of money.</p>

      <h3> Basic Strategies For Delinquency Recovery</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Rollover Method</p>
        <p>“The Rollover Method” is where you take the money that you have to pay your bills and use it to the cheapest bill off first and then pay the same amount until the next cheapest bill.</p>
        
        <p>Per Check</p>
        <p>This is a simple way to see how much “per check” you need to pay and is based when you get paid.
        </p>

        <p>Lease Amendment</p>
        <p> Depending of the least-to-own agreement it my offer a tool to change the due dates and frequency for your payments.  This can be useful to fix any timing issues that might occur and can keep your lease into a current status.</p>

        <p>Early Purchase Option</p>
        <p>An early purchase option, assuming it is available, is another way to payoff of your delinquent or past due account.  The savings that you get from the early purchase option you can put towards another bill like “The Rollover Strategy.”  If you don’t have another bill then you can save that money or spend it on yourself as a reward.</p>

        <p>Payment+</p>
        <p>The “Payment+ Strategy” simply means you pay more than you minimum required payment.  This can help save money in the long-term, set your up for an easier early purchase option in the future (if available) and can help with possible payment adjustments in the future. </p>

      <h3> Rules of Engagement</h3>
      <p>
        <p>Intro</p>
        <p>intro body</p>

        <p>Rule 0: At All Time, Be Honest To Yourself And To What You Owe</p>
        <p>This is basic fundamental that must not be overlooked.  The reason for this is because the worst person you can ever try to deceive is…yourself.  Self-deception when it comes to long term solutions, can be some of the costliest mistakes that people do to themselves.  If you are honest with how you are financially then you will have a clearer path to your solution.  This is why this is very first rule before rule number 1.</p>

        <p>Rule 1: If You Don't Need It, Then You Don't Need To Have It</p>
        <p>This is a very simple reflective assessment that will help you determine a priority for what you are spending your money.  If you say that you don’t need an item then it is okay to wait if you can’t buy right in that instant.  However if you 
        </p>

        <p>Rule 2: 30 ,60, 90 NEVER 120 vs 100%, 50%, 30% </p>
        <p>For rule number 2 which short hand will be called, “30, 60, 90” rule, is in reference to the number of CALANEDER DAYS that you fall past due and the percentages of how you need to pay them. For example, if you fall past due 15 days you need to take care of 100 % of the past due amount WITHIN the next 30 days.  For someone that is 60 days past due, they will need to pay at least 50% within the next 30 days and then the rest within another 30 days after that.  Note the 30 days situation is what is followed after the 60 days.  This is so that the account is always progressing back to a current status in order maintain good standing.</p>
        <p>  If someone cannot keep this rule then a return/cancelation of the lease-to-own agreement should be considered as soon as possible.  If someone were to choose to ignore this rule they need to proceed with caution because at day 120 of delinquency it can result in a charge off and repossession of item(s) can occur before 120 days of delinquency.  Charge off is the worst situation which sometimes can result in permanent bad standing with a company and can negatively impact things like the ability to rent a home or apartment, future loan/lease opportunities and negative credit reporting.</p>
