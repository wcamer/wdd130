      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Suppose that you are a lease owner and you have fallen on some hard times.  Hard times usually results in late or missing payments.  Wouldn’t it be nice to have a tool to help you get through those hard times?  
        For the past five years I have been helping people navigate through those hard times while being a lease owner.  Talking about hard times can be very personal and difficult to do with others.  For this reason my website will help provide the tools needed to simply and discreetly get lease owners back on the right track.
         </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience is anyone that has a lease-to-own agreement, also known as “lessee”.  Lessees can typically be as young as 18 years old and as old as upper 90’s.  Though the advice and solutions are not age specific typically the information is targeted specifically with those with active leases.  For those that are thinking of aquiring a lease to own agreement the information provided can help educate on possible ways to avoid delinquency altogether or minimize delinquency time on a lease.</p>

      <h3>Home page</h3> Understanding Lease-To-Own Basics
      <p>
        <h4>What Are You Paying For?</h4>
        <p>It is very common in this day for people not to read all the fine print in contracts but, here is a simple way to understand what you are signing up for. Whenever someone takes any type of payment plan to pay for something over time, you are paying for TIME as well as the item.</p>
        <p>Think of a car loan or house loan. Typically people don’t pay their house in cash all in one transaction but they do it over TIME with a loan. The same can be said for a lease-to-own agreement. The benefit is that you get to take home the item(s) without having to pay for it all upfront but, you will pay for the time it takes to pay it off.</p>

        <h4>How Much Are You Paying?</h4>
        <p>How much will a person pay on a lease-to-own agreement?  Here is a simple way to see. Take your recurring payment (payment), multiply it by how many times you will pay for the term (installments) and you get the total amount you will pay for the item over the life of the lease (total).  (Payment * Installments = Total).</p>
        <p>For example, let's take a cellphone that costs $1000 and your payments are weekly at $75 and your term for the lease is 1 year (52weekly payments). If you don’t use any early purchase options and go the full length of the term, you will pay $3900 for a $1000 cellphone. Note that if this same person were to save $75 weekly it would rough 14 weeks to save up the money to buy the same $1000 cellphone upfront instead of paying more over time.</p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>There are advantages and disadvantages it all comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer to save money and pay for it all upfront, some like installment plans to pay over time to avoid any large payouts of money. With lease-to-own agreements, they can be very helpful but costly depending on your approach. Understand that the longer you take to pay, the more money you will have to payout.</p>

      <h3>Rules of Engagement</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>How To Understand These Rules</h4>
        <p>To help understand how to use the information on this site here are some rules to abide by in order to achieve success with your lease-to-own agreement. Understand that these rules are meant to be a guide and not criticize or judge. Rather these rules are to help keep you empowered to make the best decisions, promote financial progression if you are experiencing a setback, and guide you to get or maintain your financial freedom.</p>

        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>For the last bit of disclaimer before we begin, understand that there do exist many different versions of lease-to-own agreements with their own unique terms and conditions. The rules that are being presented are based on the leasing terms from one of the leading companies in the lease-to-own market.</p>
        <p>These rules and strategies can be adapted to most financial agreements but, this is not a one size fits all . User discretion is advised.</p>


        <h4>Rule 0: At All Time, Be Honest To Yourself And To What You Owe</h4>
        <p>This is basic fundamental that must not be overlooked.  The reason for this is because the worst person you can ever try to deceive is…yourself.  Self-deception when it comes to long-term solutions, can be some of the costliest mistakes that people do to themselves.  If you are honest with how you are financially then you will have a clearer path to your solution.  This is why this is very first rule before rule number 1.</p>

        <h4>Rule 1: If You Don't Need It, Then You Don't Need To Have It</h4>
        <p>This is a very simple reflective assessment that will help you determine a priority for what you are spending your money on. If you say that you don’t need the item(s) then it is okay to wait if you can’t buy it right in that instant. If the item(s) are fulfilling a desire then that is okay but, this means that if your circumstances are getting grim then, you should return the item(s) as soon as possible. When your circumstances are more stable then, you can look at trying again.</p>
        <p>However, if you decide you need the item(s) in question then, they are to be considered and treated as among the highest of priorities because you have determined the item(s) as a necessity. This means that if circumstances become grim, the item(s) should be paid for first AFTER paying for food, shelter, and well-being of life. If you cannot afford to take care of the basic necessities of life and the item(s) on the lease-to-own agreement then, you MUST RETURN the item(s) AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Do not delay.</p>


        <h4>Rule 2: 30 ,60, 90 NEVER 120 vs 100%, 50%, 30% </h4>
        <p>Rule number 2 which shorthand will be called, the “30, 60, 90” rule, is in reference to the number of CALANEDER DAYS that you fall past due and the percentages of how you need to pay them.</p>
        <p>For example, if you fall past due 15 days you need to take care of 100 % of the past due amount WITHIN the next 30 days. For someone that is 60 days past due, they will need to pay at least 50% within the next 30 days and then the rest within another 30 days after that. Note the 30 days situation is what is followed after the 60 days. This is so that the account is always progressing back to a current status in order to return to good standing.</p>
        <p>If someone cannot keep this rule then a return/cancelation of the lease-to-own agreement should be considered as soon as possible. If someone were to choose to ignore this rule they need to proceed with caution because on day 120 of delinquency it can result in a charge off and repossession of item(s) can occur before 120 days of delinquency. Charge off is the worst situation which sometimes can result in permanent bad standing with a company and can negatively impact things like the ability to rent a home or apartment, future loan/lease opportunities, and negative credit reporting.</p>


        <h4>Rule 3 The Sooner The Better</h4>
        <p>This rule is fairly simple to understand. Like it was mentioned in the "Understanding Leasing Basics" page, TIME is what is figured into the cost of the agreement. The sooner the agreement is paid, the less that is needed to be paid. The same applies to any past due amount and early purchase options if they exist. This will be discussed further in the "Simple Strategies" page.</p>


        <h4>Conclusion</h4>
        <p>These four rules are simple and should be able to provide a secure foundation on how to treat and proceed with a lease-to-own agreement. Notice that there are not many of them and they are mainly common rules that allow flexibility to help guide plans for just about anyone to use.

        <p>An early purchase option, assuming it is available, is another way to payoff of your delinquent or past due account.

        <p>Payment+</p>
        <p>The “Payment+ Strategy” simply means you pay more than you minimum required payment.  This can help save money in the long-term, set your up for an easier early purchase option in the future (if available) and can help with possible payment adjustments in the future. </p>

      <h3>Basic Strategies</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Disclaimer</h4>
        <p>For the last bit of disclaimer before we begin, understand that there does exist many different versions of lease-to-own agreements with their own unique terms and conditions. The rules that are being presented are based on the leasing terms from one of the leading companies in the lease-to-own market.</p>
        <p>These rules and strategies can be adapted to most financial agreements but, this is not a one size fits all. User discretion is advised.</p>



        <h4>Rollover Method</h4>
        <p>“The Rollover Method” is where you take the money that you have to pay your bills and use it to the cheapest bill off first and then pay the same amount until the next cheapest bill.</p>

        <h4>Example: Rollover Method </h4>
        <p>Suppose that you have 2 bills that are $100 monthly and $200 monthly respectively. This means you pay a total of $300 monthly. Imagine if you paid off the bill that is $200 monthly and combined that money with your $100 monthly bill. If the $100 monthly bill had a total left of $1200 and you continued to pay a total of $300 monthly but focused on the $1200 bill then you would pay off that bill in 4 months instead of 12 months! That means over those same 12 months, in the scenario where the $1200 is paid in 4 months, that means you would be saving 8 months' worth of payments. In addition to that if you completed an early purchase option within those 4 months then you will experience even more savings!</p>



        <h4>Per Check Method</h4>
        <p>This is a simple way to see how much “per check” you need to pay and is based when you get paid.</p>

        <h4>Example: Per Check Method</h4>
        <p>Suppose the following, your income pays you biweekly (every other Friday), your minimum payment is monthly at $300 for 1 year ($3900 in total over 12 payments) and, you have an early purchase option is for 90 days (3 months) for $1700 if you can do it. Typically speaking your income will pay you 2 times every month (some months will pay 3 times) which means you will pay $150 for each check you get to pay for the $300 monthly required (assumingyou pay it by the day it is due). If you were to pay the early purchase optionthen you will need to pay roughly $284 each check (biweekly) to complete thatearly purchase option </p>



        <h4>Lease Amendment (Note: This is not a restart)</h4>
        <p>Depending on the least-to-own agreement it may offer a tool to change the due dates and frequency of your payments. This can be useful to fix any timing issues that might occur and can keep your lease in a current status. Depending on the leasing company, it might be possible to push out the first payment on a newly amended lease-to-own agreement by 45 days. It would be like having a month and a half break from payments which might help with an early purchase option or time that can be used to take care of other bills.</p>
        

        <h4>Example: Lease Amendment</h4>
        <p>Suppose your payments are due weekly but you get paid biweekly and you want it to match your paydays. If you use a lease amendment then you can set them the way you need it.</p>



        <h4>Early Purchase Option</h4>
        <p>An early purchase option, assuming it is available, is another way to pay off a delinquent or past due account or prevent it altogether. The savings that you get from the early purchase option you can put towards another bill like “The Rollover Strategy.” If you don’t have another bill then you can save that money or spend it on yourself as a reward.</p>

        
        <h4>Payment+</h4>
        <p>The “Payment+ Strategy” simply means you pay more than your minimum required payment. This can help save money in the long-term, set you up for an easier early purchase option in the future (if available), and can help with possible payment adjustments in the future.</p>

        <h4>Example: Payment+</h4>
        <p>Suppose the following, minimum payments are $50 biweekly, past due amount $200 and you are 60 days past due. In this example if you pay only the minimum payment then you are preventing the past due amount to increase (which is good) and generally maintaining your days delinquent about the 60-day area (which is okay) however, you are not getting back to current/good standing. In order to keep in accordance to rule 2, you will need to pay at least $100 biweekly to reduce past due amount and days delinquent.</p>
